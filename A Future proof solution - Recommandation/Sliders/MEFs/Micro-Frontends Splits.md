- Orchestration
- Data Architecture
- UX Consistency

Caution

### Additional runtime system overload: both CPU and memory requirements

Please note that even when there are uber frameworks that can be used to orchestrate or compose multiple technologies, they represent an additional piece of technology to maintain.

#### Horizontal Split

The horizontal split represents a pattern that mixes components developed, released, deployed and published by independent teams, but that are integrated into a single application route or view.

Note

The composition can be done at runtime, or at build time. and it can be part of a single-page app, or a multi-page app.

Complexity and challenges of horizontal splits
The level of complexity and challenges posed by the horizontal splits are larger than those of the vertical split, particularly when integrating multiple frontend technologies.

Team knowledge ramp
State management
Routing
